# random_music_wizard
## Description
random_music_wizard is a student project, which aims to develop a musical mood manager for a room, on a raspberry pi. The principle is to create profiles, improove them with user feedback and use them to automatically create a music flow. The system will be independant, but could be connected to many phones or computers thanks to a local website, and connected to the sound system of the room with a simple jack connection.
## Advantages
The music is downloaded directly on the raspberry, this way it minimizes the tasks done by the phone and avoid the battery loss when the music is playing. Otherwise it allows the user to take a phone call, to watch a video or simply to use his phone with full performance, while having music running in the background.
## Dependencies
- python 3
- python-vlc
- requests
- simplejson
- deezloader
